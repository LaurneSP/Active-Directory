<b> About this Lab </b> 

•This project is a walkthrough of how I created an Active Directory home lab Environment using VMWare. I set up a Microsoft Server to run Active Directory on it. I then configure a Domain Controller that will allow me to run a domain. After that I ran a Powershell script to create over 1000 users in Active Directory and proceed to log into those newly created accounts on another client that uses the domain I set up to connect to the internet. This lab simulates a business environment. In this lab I'll need a Microsoft Server 2019 ISO, A Windows 10 Enterprise ISO, VMWare and a Powershell script.
